prepare_rpi_image is a collection of scripts to configure raspberry pi images prior to booting the rpi.

These are primarily aimed at "headless" configurations that don't boot into teh desktop, but will work for headless and desktop images.

The objective is to set up an rpi image so that it boots up teh 1st time with ssh enabled at a predefined static ip address so that teh desktop is not required for initial turn up.
